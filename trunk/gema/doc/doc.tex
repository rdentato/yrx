\section{Introduction}

This document is the user manual for {\bf gema}, a program whose name
stands for {\bf ge}neral purpose {\bf ma}cro processor.
This is a utility program which is run as a shell command under Unix,
MS-DOS, or Windows and can be used for performing conversions or translations
of data files or extracting information from files.

The {\tt man} page for {\bf gema} provides a tutorial introduction and a
brief reference summary, while this document provides a
more detailed specification.
It would probably be best to read the tutorial section first before
reading the rest of this document.  The command line options are fully
documented in the {\tt man} page, so will not be repeated here.

This version of the document is consistent with versions 1.2 through 1.4 of the
program.
(Note that the \verb/-version/ option can be used to check which version
you are running.)
