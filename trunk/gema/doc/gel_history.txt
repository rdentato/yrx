  0) Modified gemabuild and Makefile to recognize Mingw as a
     valid target platform.
     
     I had to add the $(EXE) to cope with Windows extension for
     executables.
 
  1) gema.c has been split in two:
      - gema.c with the main() function and ARG processing stuff
      - gema_glob.c (and gema_glob.h) with the "general" functions
    
  2) Makefile has been changed to compile a libgema.a library with
     all the source files excluding gema.c
     
     Now the executable gema is build linking gema.o to libgema.a
     it's pretty useless but helped me to check if my split was
     correct (or at least usable)
     
  3) gema.c has been modified with sections guarded by #ifdef LUA.
     If you compile gema.c with LUA undefined, you get the plain
     gema, otherwise you get gel.
     I've added the gema rules to manage  the -l and -lua options.
     
  4) Added the file gel_bind.c to the makefile. It is guarded by
     #ifdef LUA so to be compiled to void during plain gema
     compilation.
     
  5) Added an entry to the makefile to compile gel. Modified
     gemabuild to compile both gema and gel.
     
     ** It is an unsatisfactory, temporary solution, I've to think
        on how to change the building process.

   1) Added NEWLINE e OP_LUA to action.c
   
   2) Added OP_NEWLINE e OP_LUA to patimp.h
   
   3) Added fake_nl to patimp.h as extern and to read.c as
      definition (fake_nl is used to implement @newline)
   
   4) Removed "static" in front of '|delete_pattern()| and
      '|delete_patterns()| (I need to call them from gel_bind.c)
      
   5) Added a second version '|skip_comment()| that executes lua 
      code.
      
   6) Added two functions to '|cstream.c|: '|cis_eof()| that checks
      for the end of an input stream and '|cos_whole_string()| that
      returns the (null terminated) buffer used so far in a string
      output stream. 
      
   7) Added a field ('|int eof|) to '|input_stream_struct|
      ( defined in '|cstream.c|) to implement '|cis_eof()| and 
      modifed everything needed to manage it.
      
   8) In '|cstream.c| modified '|expand_output_buffer()|. Now it
      allocates one char more than specified so to be sure that
      the output buffer of a string stream can be null terminated
      (I need it for '|cos_whole_string()|.
      
   9) In match.c added the lines to manage fake_nl.

   0) Modified gemabuild (renamed gbuild) and Makefile to automate
      the building of gema, gel and gua from the same source files.

      Doing gbuild x and make x is almost the same.
      
      All the platforms recognized by gema should work (they need
      testing, of course!). Platforms are distinguished using the
      command '|uname|
      
   1) Test suites from gema and gel can be launched with
      "make test". I've collected gematest results in a file and
      checked for its length at the end. If it's non-zero the 
      test fails and the diffs are printed on the screen.
      
   2) Added the example for gel (XML parser). Needed for testing.
   
   3) Added gel.htm to the doc directory

   0) Fixed the build and test scripts so to relay only on
      '/bin/sh' functions.
      
   1) Tested on my system and on Sourceforge Compile Farm:

   0) Got a segmentation fault for gel on:
       Linux amd64-linux1 2.4.19-SMP #1 SMP Wed Aug 20 15:58:51 UTC 2003 x86_64 unknown
      for test 012 and test 015. Not investigated further!

   1) Tested ok on the other SF platforms

17 Nov 2003

   0) Modified gbuild to use -O with cc on SunOS (was a bug)

   1) Modified gema.c to be compiled on DEC OSF1 (# not in first col)

   2) Modified Makefile to use touch instead of rm -f

Dec 2003

   0) Recreated gbuild and gbuild.bat
   
   1) Modified gematest and gematest.bat
